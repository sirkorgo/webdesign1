        <h1>Game Design</h1>
        <p>while i haven't made a lot, making games is also a major passion of mine. i primarily code in Luau on Roblox, and I used to make scratch games, but it's been a while since ive done that.</p>
        <p>Here's a collection of games I made.</p>

          <h1>Ridiculous Roughhousing</h1>
          <p>Ridiculous Roughhousing is a free-for-all fighting game I made on Roblox. The twist of the game is that you fight with ridiculous weapons, and the game runs events, like acid rain to spice up the rounds. Unfortunately, the game is still in development.</p>
