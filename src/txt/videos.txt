    <h2>Video Production #1</h2>
    <p>In this project, I experimented with the Canva video editing tool. The goal was to make a 30 second video with images and audio. However, I turned the project into a YouTube video which recieved 1.5K views, and was the first video uploaded to my YouTube channel.</p>

    <h2>Create a 3 Minute Video</h2>
    <p>In this project, I was tasked with making a 3 minute video about whatever I wanted. I decided to make a video about my new Mac that I had got recently. However, I turned the project into a YouTube video which recieved 200 views, not as much as the first one and second one.</p>

    <h2>Create a 4 Minute Video</h2>
    <p>In this project, I was tasked with making a 4 minute video about whatever I wanted. I decided to continue working on videos about the Nintendo 3DS, as that seemed to be more successful on my YouTube channel. The video gained 1.9K views, almost doubling the first video's view count.</p>
